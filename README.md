# Requirements :

Dependencies must called before writting your scripts :

Tensorflow , Keras , Keras_applications, Keras_models, numpy,os,pandas

--> find more details about the needed librairies in in Train/..DataSet/Text_experiments

# How to use !

1- Clone the repository 

2- From the train folder you find four different Datasets , choose one 

3- Using Google Colab create a new notebook and type your code there , find scripts in train/..DataSet/Test_experiments

4- Find Datasets link in Train/..DataSet/DataSet , import it directly from Google Drive 

5- About the models architectures you can use the direct drive link for each model ' find it in train/..DataSet/Architecture '

6- And here you go ready to train your model

7- Evaluate your test experiments and store the dataframe result and the plots in a drive directory
